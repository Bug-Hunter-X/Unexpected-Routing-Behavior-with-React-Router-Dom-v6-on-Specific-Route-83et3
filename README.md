# React Router Dom v6 Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6.  The application functions correctly for most routes, but exhibits unexpected behavior when navigating to a specific route ('/contact').

## Issue Description

The problem is not immediately apparent in the code, making it difficult to debug.  The '/contact' route causes either an incorrect rendering or an error, while the other routes ('/' and '/about') work perfectly.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the '/' and '/about' routes - they should render correctly.
5. Navigate to the '/contact' route - this is where the unexpected behavior occurs.

## Solution

The solution involves [briefly describe the solution without revealing the code].  The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) shows the correction.  This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and careful consideration even with seemingly simple routing configurations.
